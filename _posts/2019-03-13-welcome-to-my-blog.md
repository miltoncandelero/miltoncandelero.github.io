# Who am I?
I am Milton Candelero. I am a game programmer from Argentina.  
A random name generator (circa 2007) generated the name *Elemental Code* and I took it as mine, so you can find me under that alias.

<p  style="text-align:center"><img src="/assets/images/me.jpg" alt="it's a me" width="200"/></p>

I am currently working for an company called Killabunnies and I specialize in making Haxe/OpenFL HTML5 games.

These are some of the games we've done
